# WXCC Desktop JavaScript SDK

WXCC Desktop JavaScript SDK is an npm package that allows you to request up-to-date information from the WXCC Desktop. Using the SDK, you can request information such as agent details, assigned tasks, particular task details, current browser locale, and authentication token for Single Sign-On (SSO) integration.

The SDK package allows you to

* request data to be passed to your widgets through properties and attributes

* perform more complex operations by consuming and manipulating the system data inside your widget

* subscribe to data arriving asynchronously

Some events in the WXCC Desktop happen asynchronously. To subscribe to the asynchronous events and access data within the payload, you can add a listener. A few examples for asynchronous events are:

* New task offered

* New task assigned

* Consult request created

* Consult ended

* Screen pop arrived and more

## Get Started
